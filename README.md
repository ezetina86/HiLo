# Hi-Lo
*Playable game in Java: Hi-Lo guessing game, this is a command line application.*

_When the program
runs, the prompt will ask the user to guess a number
between 1 and 100. Each time they guess, the program
will tell them whether the guess is too high,
too low, or correct._

for a basic version of the game I made the
following :

1. Generate a random number between -100 and 100 for the user to guess.
2. Display a prompt, or a line of text, asking the user to guess a number in that range.
3. Accept the user’s guess as input.
4. Compare the user’s guess to the computer’s number to see if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Display the results on the screen.
6. Prompt the user to guess another number until they guess correctly.
7. Ask the user if they’d like to play again.
